### Importante
Demo version (6/5/2025) can be played for mostly 5-10 minutes. Full version of the game is predicted to take around 1h - 1.5h to complete a full run. The most enticing part is a future use of a learning algorythm for Enemy(ies), which is not yet implemented as of time of writing this update, but should be considered a priority after fixing current bugs. 

### Info
  HIOB (working title)â€”prototype of a game created for Cognitive Science Hackaton on 05.05/06.05 Current version is still a work in progress. <br/>

### Quick Rundown
1. Creates a procedurally generated map of locations.
2. Teleports player and enemy character between locations in chase sequences.
3. The routes of levels in a single run are based on non-euclidean algorythm. 
4. Enemies chase the player character, resulting in a game over screen.
5. Player completes a puzzle-like objectives to unlock the ending of the game. Including interacting and collecting objects.
6. Some AI-generated assets in graphics. These, and most other types of visual assets are temporary stand-ins.
7. Sprites of Hiob, the hivemind drones, and the main enemy; also three OST tracks are created by dev team.
8. Use of ChatGPT / help to code implementation.
